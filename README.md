## Problem Statement

 The traditional waste collection system in cities relies on routine garbage trucks, which only cover limited areas of the city, resulting in inadequate waste management. Additionally, citizens often face difficulties in finding convenient and efficient ways to dispose of their garbage. Therefore, there is a need for a modern and cost-effective mobile application that can efficiently manage the high volume of daily waste while providing citizens with a user-friendly solution for waste disposal.
 
 ## Solution proposed
  Our solution is a mobile application designed for efficient waste management that offers features for both administrators, drivers, and users. Administrators can create and manage bins by assigning a unique bin ID, selecting the city where the bin is located, and adding the bin's address, driver's email, load type, and collection frequency. The application will also provide suggestions for the best route to reach each bin location for efficient waste collection.

Administrators can also add more drivers and view complaints from users. Drivers will have access to the assigned bins and can work accordingly to collect waste as per the schedule. Users can register complaints to administrators if waste is not picked up on time, ensuring timely and efficient waste collection.

Overall, our solution is a cost-effective and sustainable way to manage waste collection in cities. It leverages the power of mobile technology to streamline waste management operations, making the process more efficient, transparent, and environmentally friendly. With our proposed solution, we hope to offer an innovative way to manage waste collection that benefits both citizens and the environment.
